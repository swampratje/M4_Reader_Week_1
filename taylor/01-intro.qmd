title: "Polynomials and approximation"
---

Polynomials are among the most important functions in mathematics and, more generally, in science. They are computationally convenient: function values and higher-order derivatives can be computed using only addition and multiplication—exactly the operations that lie at the heart of machine computation.

Polynomials are also used to approximate more complex functions. In *Mathematics 1* you saw how to approximate a function locally by its *linear approximation*—a polynomial of degree 1. @fig-linapprox illustrates this for $f(x)=e^x$, together with the linear approximations at $a=0$ and $a=1$.

This chapter studies approximation by **Taylor polynomials**, which use information about local derivatives. In doing so, we will look at sequences of *functions* (Taylor polynomials of increasing degree) rather than sequences of numbers.
