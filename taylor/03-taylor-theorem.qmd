## Why do we need a theorem? {#sec-why}

Taylor polynomials match derivatives of a function at a point. The natural next question is whether they also provide good approximations to the *function values* on some interval.

In *Mathematics 1* you saw that a linear approximation can be poor if curvature is large. The same idea appears here: approximation quality depends on higher derivatives.

### Example: linear approximation can be bad {#sec-bad-linear}

Consider
$$
f(x)=x+100x^2.
$$
The Taylor polynomials around $a=0$ are
\begin{align*}
T_0(x) &= f(0)=0,\\
T_1(x) &= f(0)+f'(0)x=x,\\
T_2(x) &= f(0)+f'(0)x+\tfrac{1}{2}f''(0)x^2=x+100x^2.
\end{align*}
The remainder after the linear approximation is
$$
R_1(x)=f(x)-T_1(x)=100x^2,
$$
which becomes large even for small deviations from $0$.

![Here $T_2(x)=f(x)$, while the straight line $T_1(x)$ is a poor approximation.](Figure9_Taylor_bad.pdf){#fig-taylor-bad width=50%}

## The remainder term {#sec-remainder}

The quality of the $n$th-order Taylor polynomial $T_n$ is measured by the **remainder term**
$$
R_n(x):=f(x)-T_n(x).
$$

## Taylor’s Theorem {#sec-taylor-theorem}

::: {#thm-taylor}
**Theorem (Taylor).**  
Let $f^{(n)}(t)$ be continuous for $a\le t\le x$ and let $f^{(n+1)}(t)$ exist for all $a<t<x$. Then there exists a point $\xi_x$ between $a$ and $x$ such that
$$
R_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi_x)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}.
$$
:::

If $x<a$, interpret “$\xi_x$ between $a$ and $x$” as $\xi_x\in(x,a)$.

To prove Taylor’s Theorem, we first prepare two results.

## Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem {#sec-cauchy-mvt}

::: {#thm-cauchy}
**Theorem (Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem).**  
Let $f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Assume $g'(x)\ne 0$ for all $x\in(a,b)$. Then there exists $\xi\in(a,b)$ such that
$$
\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}=\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}.
$$
:::

**Proof.**  
The Mean Value Theorem implies there exists $\gamma\in(a,b)$ with
$$
\frac{g(b)-g(a)}{b-a}=g'(\gamma)\ne 0,
$$
so $g(b)\ne g(a)$. Define
$$
\varphi(x):=f(x)+p\,g(x),
$$
and choose $p$ so that $\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)$:
$$
f(a)+pg(a)=f(b)+pg(b)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
p=-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.
$$
By Rolle’s Theorem there exists $\xi\in(a,b)$ with $\varphi'(\xi)=0$, i.e.
$$
f'(\xi)+p\,g'(\xi)=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
p=-\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}.
$$
Equating the two expressions for $p$ gives the result. $\square$

## A technical lemma {#sec-technical-lemma}

::: {#thm-cauchy2}
**Theorem.**  
Let $I$ be an open interval and let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be $(n+1)$ times differentiable on $I$, with
$$
f(a)=f'(a)=\cdots=f^{(n)}(a)=0.
$$
Then for any $x\in I\setminus\{a\}$ there exists a point $\xi_x$ between $a$ and $x$ such that
$$
f(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi_x)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}.
$$
:::

**Proof.**  
Assume without loss of generality that $a<x$, and let $g(x)=(x-a)^{n+1}$. Then
$$
g(a)=g'(a)=\cdots=g^{(n)}(a)=0,\qquad g^{(n+1)}(x)=(n+1)!.
$$
Applying Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem repeatedly to $(f,g)$, then $(f',g')$, and so on, yields points
$$
x_1\in(a,x),\ x_2\in(a,x_1),\ \ldots,\ x_{n+1}\in(a,x_n)
$$
such that
$$
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
=\frac{f'(x_1)}{g'(x_1)}
=\cdots
=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(x_{n+1})}{g^{(n+1)}(x_{n+1})}
=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(x_{n+1})}{(n+1)!}.
$$
Let $\xi_x:=x_{n+1}$. Then
$$
f(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi_x)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}.
$$
$\square$

## Proof of Taylor’s Theorem {#sec-proof-taylor}

**Proof.**  
Let $R_n(x)=f(x)-T_n(x)$. Since $T_n$ matches derivatives of $f$ at $a$ up to order $n$, we have
$$
R_n^{(k)}(a)=0\qquad (k=0,1,\ldots,n).
$$
Apply the previous theorem to $R_n$ to obtain a point $\xi_x$ between $a$ and $x$ with
$$
R_n(x)=\frac{R_n^{(n+1)}(\xi_x)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}.
$$
Because $T_n^{(n+1)}\equiv 0$, we have $R_n^{(n+1)}(\xi_x)=f^{(n+1)}(\xi_x)$, which gives the desired formula. $\square$

## Interpretation {#sec-interpretation}

Taylor’s Theorem says that the approximation error near $a$ depends on

- the distance $|x-a|$,
- the order $n$,
- and the behavior of the derivative $f^{(n+1)}$ between $a$ and $x$.

If $f^{(n+1)}$ behaves regularly and $x$ is close to $a$, the Taylor approximation is typically accurate; erratic higher derivatives can make approximation worse.
