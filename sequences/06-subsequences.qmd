Given a sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ and an increasing function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, the sequence
$$
\{a_{f(n)}\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}
$$
is called a *subsequence* of $\{a_n\}$.

Let $a_n=(-1)^n$. Then $f(n)=2n$ defines the constant subsequence $b_n=a_{f(n)}=1$.

<summary><b>Proof (sketch)</b></summary>

For $m=1$: put all points in an interval $[a_0,b_0]$. Bisect repeatedly and keep a subinterval that contains infinitely many points. This yields nested intervals with lengths going to zero. Pick one sequence element from each interval with increasing indices; by squeezing, the subsequence converges.

For general $m$: apply the one-dimensional result to coordinates iteratively and use a diagonal subsequence so that all coordinates converge.

The sequence $(-1)^n$ does not converge, but it is bounded and has convergent subsequences, e.g. $a_{2n}=1$.

::: {.callout-note title="Example: $(\cos n,\sin n)$ is bounded; has a convergent subsequence"}
The sequence $a_n=(\cos n,\sin n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ does not converge. But since $\Vert a_n\Vert=1$ for all $n$, it is bounded and therefore has a convergent subsequence by Bolzano–Weierstrass.

## Subsequences {#sec-subsequence}

### Definition {#sec-subsequence-def}

A **subsequence** is obtained by selecting terms from a sequence while preserving their order.

Let $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence and let $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ be a **strictly increasing** function.  
Then the sequence $\{a_{f(n)}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is called a *subsequence* of $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$.

Intuitively, a subsequence is “drawn” from the original sequence by keeping some terms and discarding others, but never changing the order.

::: {.callout-note title="Example"}
Let $a_n = (-1)^n$. If we choose the increasing index map $f(n)=2n$, then
\[
b_n := a_{f(n)} = a_{2n} = 1 \quad \text{for all } n,
\]
so $\{b_n\}$ is a constant (and hence convergent) subsequence.

## Bolzano–Weierstrass {#sec-bw}

The following theorem will be important in numerous applications in proofs in the second part of the course. You will also encounter it in the second reader, only then confined to a slightly different setting. 



::: {#thm-bw}
**Theorem (Bolzano–Weierstrass).**  
Let $\{x_n\}$ be a bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^m$. Then it has a convergent subsequence.

First consider the case $m=1$. Let $(x_n)$ be a bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$, so there exists $M>0$ such that
$$
x_n \in [a_0,b_0]:=[-M,M]\qquad \text{for all }n.
$$
Subdivide $[a_0,b_0]$ into two subintervals of equal length. At least one of these contains infinitely many terms of the sequence.
Subdivide that interval again into two equal parts, and continue inductively. In this way we obtain a nested sequence of intervals
$$
[a_1,b_1]\supseteq [a_2,b_2]\supseteq \cdots
$$
such that each interval $[a_k,b_k]$ contains infinitely many terms of $(x_n)$ and
$$
b_k-a_k=\frac{2M}{2^k}=\frac{M}{2^{k-1}}\to 0.
$$

Moreover, $(a_k)$ is non-decreasing and bounded above by $M$, while $(b_k)$ is non-increasing and bounded below by $-M$.
By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, both $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$ converge. Since $b_k-a_k\to 0$, they converge to the same limit,
say $\ell$.

Now choose a subsequence as follows: pick $x_{n_1}\in[a_1,b_1]$; then pick $x_{n_2}$ with $n_2>n_1$ such that
$x_{n_2}\in[a_2,b_2]$; and so on. This yields indices $n_1<n_2<\cdots$ with
$$
a_k \le x_{n_k} \le b_k\qquad\text{for all }k.
$$
By the Squeeze Theorem, $x_{n_k}\to \ell$. Hence every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

For the general case $m\ge 1$, write
$$
x_n=(x_{n,1},\ldots,x_{n,m})\in\mathbb{R}^m.
$$
If $\|x_n\|\le M$ for all $n$, then each coordinate is bounded: $|x_{n,i}|\le M$ for all $n$ and each $i$.
By the one-dimensional case, the first-coordinate sequence $(x_{n,1})$ has a convergent subsequence
$(x_{n^{(1)}_k,1})$.

Restricting to the corresponding subsequence of vectors $(x_{n^{(1)}_k})$, the second-coordinate sequence
$(x_{n^{(1)}_k,2})$ is still bounded, so it has a convergent subsequence $(x_{n^{(2)}_k,2})$.
Continue this diagonal-subsequence construction through coordinate $m$.

In the end, we obtain a subsequence $(x_{n^{(m)}_k})$ such that **every coordinate converges**, hence the vector subsequence
converges in $\mathbb{R}^m$.

::: {.callout-note title="Example"}
The sequence $a_n = (-1)^n$ does not converge, but it is bounded since $|a_n|=1$ for all $n$.  
The subsequence $a_{2n}=1$ converges (to $1$).
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Example"}
Consider $a_n=(\cos n,\sin n)\in\mathbb{R}^2$. This sequence does not converge, but it is bounded since
\[
\|a_n\|=\sqrt{\cos^2 n+\sin^2 n}=1 \quad \text{for all } n.
\]
Therefore, by Bolzano–Weierstrass, it has a convergent subsequence.
