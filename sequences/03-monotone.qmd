title: 'Monotonic convergence'
---

In this chapter we examine two qualitative properties that are very useful to show convergence: **boundedness** and **monotonicity**. Many times we do not have a closed formula for the sequence (or it is hard to obtain), but these qualitative tools still let us prove convergence.

::: {.callout-note title="Monotonicity"}
A sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is *monotonic* if either:

- $a_{n}\geq a_{n+1}$ for all $n$ (monotonically decreasing), or
- $a_{n+1}\geq a_n$ for all $n$ (monotonically increasing).
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Boundedness"}
A sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is *bounded* if there is a constant $M>0$ such that
$$
-M\leq a_n\leq M \quad \text{for all } n.
$$

**Theorem (Monotonic Convergence Theorem).**  
Suppose $\{a_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is bounded and monotonic. Then the limit
$$
L=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}a_n
$$
exists.

<summary><b>Proof (increasing case)</b></summary>

Assume $\{a_n\}$ is monotonically increasing and bounded. Then
$$
L=\sup\{a_n\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}
$$
exists. Take $\varepsilon>0$. Since $L$ is the least upper bound, $L-\varepsilon$ is not an upper bound, so there exists $N$ with
$L-\varepsilon < a_N \le L$. Because the sequence is increasing, for all $n\ge N$ we have
$L-\varepsilon < a_n \le L$, hence $|a_n-L|<\varepsilon$.

A proof for decreasing sequences is similar (use the infimum).

::: {.callout-note title="Worked example: an iteratively defined sequence"}
Consider the sequence defined by
$$
a_1=1,\qquad a_{n+1} =3-\frac{1}{a_n}.
$$
We want to understand the long-term behavior and compute $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n$.

We show:
- $\{a_n\}$ is increasing,
- $\{a_n\}$ is bounded.

*Increasing (induction).* Define $P(n): a_{n+1}> a_n$. Then $P(1)$ holds since $a_2=3-1/a_1=2>a_1$. Assume $P(k)$ holds so that $a_{k+1}>a_k>\cdots>a_1=1$. Then
$$
a_{k+2}=3-\frac{1}{a_{k+1}}> 3-\frac{1}{a_k}=a_{k+1},
$$
so $P(k+1)$ holds.

*Bounded.* One can show $a_n\le 3$ for all $n$ (and all terms stay positive).

By the Monotonic Convergence Theorem, $L=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n$ exists. Compute:
$$
L=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n+1}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\left(3-\frac{1}{a_n}\right)
=3-\frac{1}{L}.
$$
So $L$ solves $L=3-\frac{1}{L}$, i.e.
$$
L=\tfrac{3}{2}+\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{5}
$$
(the other root is not compatible with the sequence).
